# personal_bio_webpage
This is my very first website using bootstrap, css, and html.

For this project I used bootstrap inside my html file in order to add style and make a responsive website.
This was my first website from scratch so I ran into many struggles.
I was able to create opperational links that changes colors when hovered over, clicked on, and when the page was active.
I was able to add a container to each page with a working footer and header that was responsive with smaller and larger window sizes.

One of the biggest struggels with this project was figuring out the correct css code in order to make it look good, and format correctly.
Very excited to keep improving this page and adding more about me to it.


ABOUT ME

<img src="./images/about.jpg" alt="About Me Page" width="300"/>
In this page I put an image of me and information about me in a personal page and set it as my home screen. I then created a container and put rows and columns inside the container to create spacing between the picture and my text. I floated the picture to the left so the text would wrap when the screen got smaller.


PORTFOLIO

<img src="./images/portfolio.jpg" alt="Portfolio Page" width="300"/>
I used the same template as my about me page and inside the container I put pictures to represent my portfolio and spaced them out using bootstraps grid system with rows and colums. I used line breaks to create space between them vertically. In the css file I made the pictures change position when the window size got to a certain width and height.


CONTACT

<img src="./images/contact.jpg" alt="Contact Page" width="300"/>
For this page I used the same template as my about me page and put inside the container a form group with opitional text using rows and colums to make a submission form for someone to contact the company/author of the page. I used a button in bootstrap to create the send button.
